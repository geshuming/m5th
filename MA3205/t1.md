> For each \(n \in \N\), let \(A_n = \set{0,\dots,n}\). What are the elements of \(\displaystyle\prod_{n\in\N} A_n\)?

By definition,
\[\prod_{n\in\N} A_n = \set{f : f\text{ is a function } \land \dom(f) = \N \land \forall i\in\N \sqbr{f(i) \in A_i} } \]
which is the collection of all functions \(f : \N \to \N\) where for each \(i\in\N\), \(f(i) \in \set{0,\dots,i}\).

I think of it as the collection of all sequences bounded above by the sequence \(X_n = n\),
that is, at each coordinate \(f(i) \leq X_i\).
