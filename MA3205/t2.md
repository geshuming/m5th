# Exercise 3.5

> Let \(A\) and \(B\) be sets. Use the rules to verify that the following are sets:
>
> 1. \(\dom(A)\);
> 2. \(\ran(A)\);
> 3. \(\bigcap A\);
> 4. \(A^B\);

__Definition 2.6.__
For any set \(R\), \(\dom(R) = \set{a : \exists b\sqbr{\ang{a,b} \in R}}\) and
\(\ran(R) = \set{b : \exists a\sqbr{\ang{a,b} \in R}}\).

### 1. \(\dom(A)\) is a set.
Define \(F = \set{x : \exists a\exists b\sqbr{x = \ang{\ang{a,b},a}}}\), which is a class by rule 3.
By rule 5 since \(A\) is a set,
\(\Im_F(A) = \set{a : \exists b\sqbr{\ang{a,b}\in A \land \ang{\ang{a,b},a} \in F} }\) is a set.
Note that definition of \(\Im_F(A)\) coincides with that of \(\dom(A)\).

### 2. \(\ran(A)\)
Similar argument.

### 3. \(\bigcap A\)

### 4. \(A^B\).

By earlier exercise \(B\times A\) is a set, then by rule 6 so is \(\P(B\times A)\).

# Exercise 3.6
> Let \(I\) be a set and \(\ang{A_i : i\in I}\) a sequence of sets.
> Verify that \(\prod_{i\in I} A_i\) is a set.

\(I\) is a set so by axiom or replacement, \(\set{A_i : i\in I}\) is a set, then \(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\) is also a set.
Note that a member \(f\in \prod_{i\in I} A_i\) is a function from \(I\), whose output at each \(i\in I\) is in \(A_i\).
So \(\ran(f)\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\).
Then for every \(f\in\prod_{i\in I}A_i\), \(f \subseteq I \times \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i \implies f \in \P\left(I \times \bigcup_{i\in I}A_i \right)\).
By earlier exercise the product is a set, then by rule 6 the power of the product is a set too.

# Exercise 3.7
> Let \(R\) and \(A\) be sets. Show that if \(R\) is a relation, then \(\Im_R(A)\) is a set.

*Proof.*
Suppose \(R\) is a relation, as \(R\) is a set by exercise 3.5 \(\ran(R)\) is a set.
Because \(\Im_R(A) \subseteq \ran(R)\), by rule 4 \(\ran(R) \cap \Im_R(A) = \Im_R(A)\) is a set too.
\hfill$\square$

# Exercise 3.8

> Show that the class \(\vec{U} = \set{ x : \exists a \exists b \sqbr{x = \ang{a,b}} }\) is not a set.

*Proof.*
Suppose for a contradiction \(\vec{U}\) is a set.
Let \(R\) be the Russell class defined in Theorem 3.1, that is let \(R = \set{x : x\text{ is a set }\land x \notin x}\).
Consider the class \(R\times R = \set{x : \exists a\in R \exists b\in R \sqbr{x = \ang{a,b}}}\) which is a collection of sets.
Since \(\vec{U}\) is a set, \((R\times R) \cap \vec{U} = R\times R\) is a set by rule 4.
By exercise 3.5, \(\dom(R\times R) = R\) is a set too, contradicting theorem 2.1.
\hfill$\square$


# Exercise 3.9

> Let \(F\) be a class. Show that if \(F\) is a function and if \(\dom(F)\) is a set,
> then \(F\) is a set.

*Proof.*
\(F\) is a function and \(\dom(F)\) is a set, so by axiom of replacement (rule  5), \(\Im_F(\dom(F)) = \ran(F)\) is a set.
Applying Example 3.4, \(\dom(F) \times \ran(F)\) is also a set.
Since \(F\) is a function, \(F \subseteq \dom(F) \times \ran(F)\),
then by rule 4, \(F = F \cap (\dom(F) \times \ran(F))\) is a set.
\hfill$\square$
