# Labs vs Recitation

* Lab: Work on a (graded) assignment.  
    \textsmall{Lab PCs are limited, please try not to crash other sessions.}

* Tutorial: Discuss concepts covered in lecture.

# How lab assignments work

* Normal labs (8$\times$) -- 10% of final grade,

* Practical assessments (2$\times$) -- $15 + 20$% of final grade.

$\implies$ **All** labs contribute to your final grade!

### During lab session

* Download question from plab server and read it

* Write code on plab server to solve the question (no feedback)

### After lab session

* We will retrieve your code from plab server and submit to CodeCrunch for you  
  \textsmall{Should be done by 8pm.}

* You can re-submit/touch up the code on CodeCrunch until **Friday, 2359hrs**

---

### Normal labs
* Discuss away!

* Only your last submission on CodeCrunch is counted

* Remember to save your work on the plab server before leaving!

### Practical assessments
* No discussions
<!---
* Your score is the maximum of
  - plab server submission
  - final CodeCrunch submission adjusted by similarity score
-->
* Same coding environment as now (but more locked down).


# Grading
* Each task is separated into a few "levels"

* **\textcolor{red}{Submit all levels.}**

* Marks are awarded for functionality (auto-graded)

# Let's get started!

* Check email for personal plab account credentials

    - You also need your NUSNET ID to log in to plab (hostname is something like `peXXX`)

* Place your `main()` method into `class Main`

* Design abstractions for points and circles

<!-- vim: set nospell : -->
