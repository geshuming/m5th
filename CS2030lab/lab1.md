# Labs vs Tutorials

* Lab: Work on a (graded) assignment.  
    \textsmall{Lab PCs are limited, please try not to crash other sessions.}

* Tutorial: Discuss concepts covered in lecture.

# How lab assignments work

* Normal labs (8$\times$) -- 10% of final grade,

* Practical assessments (2$\times$) -- $15 + 20$% of final grade.

$\implies$ **All** labs contribute to your final grade!

### During lab session
